# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting **Customer Churn** — determining whether a customer will continue or discontinue services based on various factors like tenure, payment methods, and monthly charges.  

The dataset used in this project is **`Customer Churn.csv`**, which provides customer-level information that can be used for **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning modeling**.

## 🧠 **Project Overview**

Customer churn refers to when customers stop using a company's product or service.  
This project explores customer data to:
- Identify the **key reasons behind churn**
- Build predictive models to **anticipate customer loss**
- Help organizations **improve customer retention strategies**

By leveraging **machine learning**, we can analyze churn patterns and provide valuable business insights.
